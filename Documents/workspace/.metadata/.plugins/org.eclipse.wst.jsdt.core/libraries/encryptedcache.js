/**
 * @class
 * 		<p>Encrypted offline cache is a mechanism for storing sensitive data on the client application.<br />
 * 		You can also use the JSONStore feature to obtain reliable secure on-device storage of data. If you previously used the Encrypted offline cache (EOC) feature, 
 * 		you can now use this improved on-device storage method for offline access. In addition, the JSONStore allows to populate and update data from an adapter on the server. 
 * 		technique provides a better alternative for storing adapter data offline and synchronizing with a server the changes that were done when offline. 
 * 		If you are developing a Worklight&reg; hybrid app to target both iOS and Android, consider using JSONStore rather than EOC. HTML5 cache, as used in EOC, 
 * 		is not guaranteed to be persistent on future iOS versions. JSONStore uses the same encryption form and security mechanisms as EOC (PBKDF2 for key derivation from user password and AES 256). 
 * 		EOC continues to be supported as a cross-platform on-device data store mechanism for various mobile client OS platforms, but no major technical updates will be made to the EOC feature set.</p>
 * 		
 * 		<p>The cache uses HTML5 local storage to store user data. HTML5 imposes a limit of 5 MB, which is equivalent to approximately 1.3 MB of unencrypted text. 		
 * 		If you exceed this limit, the behavior is undefined. If you use a large amount of cache, you might experience delays in processing it.</p>
 *
 *    <p>The HTML5 LocalStorage specification does not require methods to wait until the data has been physically written to the disk to execute the next line of
 *    code. The only requirement is consistency in what different scripts that access the same underlying list of key-value pairs see. Thus, you might run into
 *    cases when the success or failure callback is executed before data is changed on the disk.</p>
 * 		
 * 		<p>Data is stored in key-value pairs. Data is encrypted by using a 256-bit encryption key. The encryption key is itself encrypted, using a separate 256-bit encryption key. 
 * 		That key is generated from the user’s password by using the PKCS #5 PBKDF2 function.</p>
 * 
 * 		<p>The encrypted offline cache is available for mobile, desktop, and web environments that support HTML5.</p>
 * 		
 * 		<p>As an alternative to encrypted offline cache, you can use a JSONStore object.</p>
